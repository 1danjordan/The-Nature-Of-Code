# The-Nature-Of-Code
This repo contains the examples and snippets of code from The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman. 

The objective of this book is to simulate natural systems with processing, a creative coding language.

This repo is strictly for maintaining and updating my progress as I learn. I'll include some GIFs of the simulations straight into this README below.
