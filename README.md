# The-Nature-Of-Code
This repo contains the examples and snippets of code from The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman. 

The objective of this book is to simulate natural systems with processing, a creative coding language.

This repo is strictly for maintaining and updating my progress as I learn. I'll include some GIFs of the simulations straight into this README below.

###Random Walk
![2D Walkers](https://github.com/dandermotj/The-Nature-Of-Code/blob/master/Introduction/Walker_Gif/export.gif)

This animation shows three random walkers moving in 2 Dimension. If you let them walk for long enough you get some amazing art like results!

###Orbit
![Orbiting Balls](https://github.com/dandermotj/The-Nature-Of-Code/blob/master/Vectors/Orbit_Gif/export.gif)

This animation shows gravity pulling balls of different mass towards an invisible point in the center of the screen. The physics engine behind the orbitors is actually very basic, but works really well.
